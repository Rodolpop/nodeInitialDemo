# DEVELOPERS TEAM - NETFLIX
💻

 “Developers Team” group project from the It Academy node.js bootcamp.
Successful completion of the exercise is equivalent to having completed approximately 50% of the course.
The console program will allow to perform CRUD operations to keep a list of tasks to perform. 
1) Create => Add new Serie to Watchlist
2) Read => List All Series, with three possible the current state:
=> Wishlist: series saved but not started to watch yet. 
=> Watching List: series removed from Wishlist and being watched (but not finished yet).
=> Already Watched: series removed from Watching List. 
3) Update them only forward: First you add new Serie to Wishlist, then you watch it and finally you finish watching it. 
4) Finally you can remove them directly.
